# browserCanvas

Is a basic online whiteboard

To use either download the file or "git clone https://github.com/cam-shotter/browserCanvas.git", install dependencies "npm i"
and run "npm start"



## To do
* ~~Convert limited color select to an unlimited color picker~~
* ~~Create buttons to change line weight~~
* ~~Figure out proper UI so it isn't as chaotic and ugly (potentially have canvas take up whole background?)~~
* Create ability to change brush type
* Create ability to save current drawing between sessions
* Create ability to clear current canvas
* Fix the janky way that lines are drawn currently. Temporary line weight based solution bugs me
* Create log in
... Will need database first
... Is a log in actually necessary?
* Look into web sockets so multiple people can collaborate
