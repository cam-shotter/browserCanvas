# browserCanvas

Is a basic online whiteboard

To use either download the file or "git clone https://github.com/cam-shotter/browserCanvas.git", install dependencies "npm i"
and run "npm start"



## To do
* Convert limited color select to an unlimited color picker
* Create buttons to change line weight
* Figure out proper UI so it isn't as chaotic and ugly (potentially have canvas take up whole background?)
* Write functions for save and delete buttons
* Create log in
..* Will need database first
..* Is a log in actually necessary?
* Look into web sockets so multiple people can collaborate
